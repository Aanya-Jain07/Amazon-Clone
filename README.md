🧩 Amazon-Inspired Static Homepage
This project recreates the visual layout of an Amazon-like e-commerce homepage using HTML and CSS only. It includes styled navigation, product category sections, and responsive design—ideal for practicing front-end UI development and layout structuring.
⚙️ Tech Stack
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Font Awesome (CDN for icons)
🖼️ Features
- Fully Styled Navigation Bar
Includes location indicator, search bar with categories, account options, and cart icon.
- Homepage Banner Section
Displays promotional image with full-width styling.
- Product Categories
Six well-defined sections:
- Home Appliances
- Home Styling & Decor
- Headphones
- Automotive Essentials
- Fashion Accessories
- Kitchen Tools
- Custom Buttons
Each section includes a "See More" button—styled but not yet functional.
- Structured Footer
Provides informational panels about company links, social media, seller tools, and help center.

Optimized for mobile viewing with stacked components, resized navigation, and image scaling.
📂 Folder Structure
project-folder/
├── index.html         → Main HTML file
├── style1.css         → External stylesheet
└── amazon.png         → Local logo file for navbar/footer


⚠️ Limitations
- No JavaScript Yet
All buttons and form elements are presentational only (no interactivity).
- Static Links
Anchor tags in the footer are non-clickable placeholders.
🚀 Future Ideas
Here’s what you could add later:
- JavaScript-driven interactivity (e.g. cart behavior, search filtering)
- Linkable product details or modal pop-ups
- Category filtering and sorting
- Hover animations and transitions
